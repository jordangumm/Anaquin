somatic - Assess the detection of somatic variants in sequins (and sample).

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
    Required:
        --sequin                        Sequin somatic variant file (.VCF) generated by variant-calling software (such as Strelka, Mutect etc.)
    Or:                                 with sequin alignments to the human genome (e.g. hg38)
        --combined                      Variant file (.VCF) that contains both sample somatic variants (called with alignments to the human genome, e.g. hg38)
                                        and sequin somatic variants (called with alignments to the sequin decoy chromosome, e.g. chrQS)

    Optional:
        --sample                        Sample somatic variant file (.VCF) generated by variant calling software (such as Strelka, Mutect etc.)
                                        with sample alignments to the human genome (e.g. hg38).
                                        This option should only be used in conjunction with the --sequin input option.
        --human_regions                 Manually supply a sequin regions annotation (.BED) relative to the human genome (e.g., hg38).
                                        instead of using default sequin regions (compatible with both --sequin/--sample or --combined input option).
        --decoy_regions                 Manually supply a sequin regions annotation (.BED) relative to the sequin decoy chromosome (e.g., chrQS)
                                        instead of using default sequin regions (only when using the --combined input option).
        --restrict_regions              Supply custom annotation file (.BED) containing regions of interest in the human genome (e.g. capture-sequencing targets).
                                        Anaquin will limit analysis to the intersection of these regions with the sequin regions.
        --genome_variants               Manually supply a sequin variant annotation (.VCF) relative to the human genome (e.g., hg38)
                                        instead of using default sequin variant annotation (only when using the --sequin input option).
        --decoy_variants                Manually supply a sequin variant annotation (.VCF) relative to the sequin decoy chromosome (e.g., chrQS)
                                        instead of using default sequin variant annotation (only when using the --combined input option).
        --report                        Generate report describing detection of sequin (and sample) germline variants.
        --build                         Specify hg38, hg19, grch37 or grch38 human reference genome build (default = hg38).
        --edge                          Size (nt) of sequin terminal regions which should be ignored when assessing performance to avoid impact of
                                        sequencing edge-effects (default = 550).
        -o/--output                     Directory to which output files are written (default = output).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
    To asssess separate VCF files containing sequin and sample variants:
    $ anaquin somatic --sequin sequin.hg38.vcf --sample sample.hg38.vcf

    To asssess a VCF file containing both sequin and sample variants:
    $ anaquin somatic --combined combined.hg38chrQ.vcf
