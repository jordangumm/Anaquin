calibrate - Sequin alignments are calibrated to match the alignment coverage of the accompanying human genome sample. Calibrate calculates the sample
            alignment coverage within human regions, and then scales the alignment coverage of corresponding sequin regions accordingly.

<b>TOOL OPTIONS</b>
    Required:
        --sequin                    Sequin alignments to human genome (e.g. hg38, .SAM/BAM).
        --sample                    Sample alignments to human genome (e.g. hg38, .SAM/BAM).
    Or:    
        --combined                  Alignment file (.SAM/BAM) that contains both sample alignments (to human genome, e.g. hg38)
                                    and sequin alignments (to sequin decoy chromsomes e.g. chrQ).
    Optional:
        --human_regions             Manually supply regions of the human genome (e.g. hg38, .BED) to be used for calibration between sequin
                                    and sample alignments (compatible with both --sequin/--sample or --combined input option).
                                    If not specified, anaquin will use its own internal reference file.
        --decoy_regions             Manually supply regions of the sequin decoy chromsome that will be calibrated to sequin regions in
                                    the human genome with matching IDs (only when using the --combined input option).
                                    If not specified, anaquin will use its own internal reference file.
        --restrict_regions          Restrict calibration to custom regions (.BED) of interest in the human genome (e.g. capture-sequencing targets).
                                    Anaquin will limit calibration to the intersection of these regions with the sequin regions.
        --build                     Specify hg38, hg19, grch37 or grch38 human reference genome build (default = hg38).
        --method                    Method used to calculate sequence coverage. Possible values are mean (default), median and x (fractional
                                    value for calibration, 0 < x < 1).
        --edge                      Size (nt) of sequin terminal regions that should be ignored when calculating calibration factor to avoid
                                    impact of sequencing edge-effects (default = 550).
        -o/--output                 Directory to which output files are written (default = output).
        -t/--threads                Number of threads used (default = 1).
        -r/--resource_dir           Directory containing resource files (default = resources).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE</b>
    To calibrate a sequin-derived alignment file to a sample-derived alignment file:
    $ anaquin calibrate --sequin sequin.hg38.bam --sample sample.hg38.bam

    To calibrate an alignment file containing both sequin and sample alignments:
    $ anaquin calibrate --combined sample_with_sequins.hg38chrQ.bam

    To calibrate with only the sequin derived alignment file:
    $ anaquin calibrate --sequin sequin.bam --method 0.10
