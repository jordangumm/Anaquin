split - Partition a NGS library (.FASTQ) file into two libraries: reads from sequins and reads from the accompanying (human) sample. Sequin reads will be reversed, so they match the orientation of the human reference genome. Also reports on sequin performance in NGS library.

<b>Notes</b>
If the --combined option is used, the sample reads in split_sample_* will be empty.

<b>TOOL OPTIONS:</b>
    Required:
        -1                              Input FASTQ file (first pair)
    Or:
        --combined                      Input BAM file containing sample and sequin alignments.
                                        Sequin reads must be aligned to the sequin decoy chromosomes (chrQ).
    Optional:
        -2                              Input FASTQ file (second pair)
        --report                        Generate automated report of sequin performance in library.
        -o/--output                     Directory to which output files are written (default = output).
        -t/--threads                    Number of threads used (default = 1).
        --threshold                     Minimum fraction of kmers required to classify read as sequin-derived (default = 0.2).
        --kmer                          K-mer length (default = 23).
        --skip                          Assess every nth k-mer in read. Skipping more k-mers allows faster computation (default = 5).
        -r/--resource_dir               Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --manual_fasta                  Supply custom sequence catalog (.FASTA; instead of using default sequin sequence catalog).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
    To split a paired-end FASTQ library:
    $ anaquin split -1 sample_with_sequins.1.fq -2 sample_with_sequins.2.fq

    To split a BAM alignment file:
    $ anaquin split --combined sample_with_sequins.bam

    split_info_*                    FASTQ (or BAM) file of informative sequin reads.
    split_ladder_*                  FASTQ (or BAM) file of sequin ladder reads.
    split_mito_*                    FASTQ (or BAM) file of (flipped) sequin mitochondria reads.
    split_sv_*                      FASTQ (or BAM) file of (flipped) structural variant reads.
