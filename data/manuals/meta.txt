meta - analyse sequins within metagenome samples.

<b>TOOL OPTIONS:</b>
    Required:
        -1                          Input FASTQ file (first pair)
    Or:
        --combined                  Input BAM file containing sample and sequin alignments (to chrQ*, the decoy chromosomes).

    Optional:
        -2                          Input FASTQ file (second pair)
        --mix                       Specify the sequin mixture used (e.g. default = A (mixture A)).
        --sequin_calibration        Specify the library fraction to which sequin reads/alignments are calibrated (for example 0.01 calibrates
                                    sequin reads/alignments to 1% of library depth) (default = NA).
        --ladder_calibration        Similar to --sequin_calibrate but applies to ladder reads/alignments (default = NA).     
        --report                    Generate html graphic report of sequin performance in library.
        --nomerge                   Skip merging sample and calibrated outputs. Useful for avoiding the slow merging step.
        --noflip                    Skip sequin read flipping
        -o/--output                 Directory to which output files are written (default = output).
        -t/--threads                Number of threads used (default = 1).
        --threshold                 Minimum fraction of kmers required to classify read as sequin-derived (default = 0.2).
        --kmer                      K-mer length (default = 23).
        --skip                      Assess every nth k-mer in read. Skipping more k-mers allows faster computation (default = 5).
        -r/--resource_dir           Directory containing resource files (default = resources).
        --manual_fasta              Supply custom sequence catalog (.FASTA; instead of using default sequin sequence catalog).
        --manual_bed                Supply custom sequin regions annotation (.BED; instead of using default sequin annotations).

<b>USAGE EXAMPLE:</b>
    $ anaquin meta -1 file1.fq.gz -2 file2.fq.gz  (to meta a paired-end FASTQ library).
    $ anaquin meta --combined align.bam (to meta a BAM alignment file).
